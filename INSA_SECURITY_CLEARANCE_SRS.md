## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the security architecture, data flow, and functional specifications for the integration of the Telebirr In-App Payment SDK within the "Suuq S" digital marketplace platform. It demonstrates compliance with financial security standards, focusing on the integrity of the **Merchant of Record** model where Suuq S acts as the primary payment acceptor before disbursing funds to sub-merchants (vendors).

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Overview

The system operates on a Microservices-based architecture comprising three primary distinct entities:

1.  **Client Layer (Flutter Mobile App):** Determines user intent and interfaces with the Telebirr Android/iOS SDK. Protected via ProGuard obfuscation (`com.huawei.ethiopia.pay.sdk.api.core.**`).
2.  **Application Layer (NestJS Backend):** Acts as the secure orchestrator. It holds the RSA Private Keys, manages Fabric Tokens, and processes callbacks. Hosted at Static IP `134.209.94.162`.
3.  **Gateway Layer (Ethio Telecom Fabric):** The external payment processor handling the ledger and fund movements.

### 2.2 Component Diagram

Interaction logic utilizes a "Server-Signed, Client-Executed" pattern to prevent client-side tampering.

- **Fabric Token Service:** A dedicated backend service manages the lifecycle of the Telebirr access token, auto-refreshing it before expiration to prevent transaction failures.
- **Crypto Module:** Handles RSA-2048 encryption and SHA256WithRSA signing.

## 3. Data Flow Diagram (DFD)

### 3.1 Transaction Lifecycle

The transaction follows a strict **Asynchronous Verification** model. The mobile app is never trusted with payment confirmation; only the server-to-server callback validates a purchase.

#### Sequence:

1.  **Request Initialization:** User selects "Pay with Telebirr". Backend generates a signed `receiveCode` payload.
2.  **SDK Handoff:** App invokes Telebirr App via SDK using the signed payload.
3.  **Payment Execution:** User confirms PIN in Telebirr App.
4.  **Callback (Notify URL):** Telebirr server POSTs result to `https://api.suuq.ugasfuad.com/api/payments/telebirr-callback`.
5.  **Reconciliation & Disbursement:** Backend verifies signature, updates local ledger, and triggers 95/5 split via `/merchant/transfer`.

### 3.3 Data Element Dictionary

The following data elements are transmitted during the transaction lifecycle:

| field_name    | Type   | Source  | Destination | Description                                                                  |
| :------------ | :----- | :------ | :---------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `appId`       | String | Backend | Telebirr    | Unique Application ID assigned by Ethio Telecom.                             |
| `outTradeNo`  | String | Backend | Telebirr    | Unique Transaction Reference generated by Suuq.                              |
| `totalAmount` | String | Backend | Telebirr    | Transaction Value (in ETB). Anti-tamper source.                              |
| `sign`        | String | Backend | Telebirr    | `SHA256WithRSA` signature of the payload.                                    |
| `payload`     | JSON   | Backend | App         | The signed object containing `prepayId` for the SDK.                         |
| `notify_url`  | URL    | Backend | Telebirr    | The endpoint (`/api/payments/telebirr-callback`) receiving the final status. |

## 4. Business Logic & Merchant of Record

### 4.1 Merchant of Record (MoR) Model

Suuq S acts as the single point of entry for funds to ensure compliance and trust.

- **Inflow:** 100% of the cart value is debited from the customer to the "Suuq S" Master Merchant Account.
- **Ledgering:** An internal immutable ledger (`telebirr_transaction` table) records the Fabric Reference ID against the local Order ID.
- **Outflow (Disbursement):** Upon successful callback verification, the system executes an automated B2B transfer to the Vendor's registered merchant ID for their share (95%), retaining the commission (5%).

### 4.2 Data Integrity

- **Anti-Tampering:** Order amounts are stored server-side. The client cannot modify the amount sent to Telebirr; the signature is generated on the backend using the stored database value.
- **Double-Spending Prevention:** The system enforces standard Idempotency keys based on `OrderId`. Duplicate callbacks for the same ID are logged but not re-processed.

## 5. Threat Model & Security Mitigations

### 5.1 Identified Threats

| Threat ID | Description                   | Severity | Mitigation Strategy                                                                                                              |
| :-------- | :---------------------------- | :------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **TR-01** | **Replay Attacks**            | High     | Implementation of **Timestamp Nonce**. Requests outside a 60-second window (NTP Synced) are rejected by the Fabric Gateway.      |
| **TR-02** | **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)**  | Critical | 1. Strict SSL/TLS enforcement. <br> 2. **RSA-2048 Encryption** (PKCS1 Padding) for sensitive payload data.                       |
| **TR-03** | **Unauthorized Disbursement** | Critical | Disbursement API endpoints are firewalled and accessible only via internal logic triggers, not exposed to the public API client. |
| **TR-04** | **SDK Reverse Engineering**   | Medium   | **ProGuard Obfuscation** applied to `com.huawei.ethiopia.pay.sdk.api.core.**` to hide internal logic in the Android APK.         |
| **TR-05** | **Fake Callbacks**            | High     | All incoming callbacks to `notify_url` must pass **SHA256WithRSA** signature verification using the Telebirr Public Key.         |

### 5.2 Cryptographic Standards

- **Asymmetric Key:** RSA 2048-bit keys generated via OpenSSL.
- **Signature Algorithm:** `SHA256WithRSA`.
- **Payload Encryption:** AES / RSA hybrid approach where applicable (following Fabric V3 specs).

## 6. Functional & Non-Functional Requirements

### 6.1 Functional Requirements (FR)

**User & Transaction Management:**

1.  **FR-01 (Transaction Initialization):** The system MUST generate a unique `outTradeNo` (Order ID) for every distinct payment attempt to prevent transaction collisions.
2.  **FR-02 (Signature Generation):** The backend MUST sign all outgoing requests to the Telebirr Fabric gateway using the securely stored RSA-2048 Private Key.
3.  **FR-03 (Callback Verification):** The system MUST intercept all `notify_url` POST requests and verify the `sign` parameter using the official Telebirr Public Key before processing.

**Reconciliation & Integrity:** 4. **FR-04 (Status Synchronization):** Upon successful signature verification, the system MUST atomically update the local Order status from `PENDING` to `PAID`. 5. **FR-05 (Manual Query):** The system MUST provide an Admin Interface to manually trigger the `queryOrder` Fabric API to resolve status discrepancies for "Stuck" transactions (e.g., network timeout during callback). 6. **FR-06 (Double-Spend Protection):** The system MUST reject any callback with a `outTradeNo` that has already been marked as `PAID` in the ledger.

**Disbursement Logic (Business Rules):** 7. **FR-07 (Commission Calculation):** The system MUST automatically calculate the platform fee (5%) and the vendor payout (95%) immediately upon receipt of funds. 8. **FR-08 (Automated Payout):** The system MUST trigger a B2B transfer to the Vendor's registered merchant account for their 95% share only AFTER the initial customer debit is confirmed.

### 6.2 Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)

**Security & Compliance:**

1.  **NFR-01 (Key Management):** Private Keys and App Secrets MUST be stored in environment variables (server-side) and NEVER exposed to the client-side code or Git repository.
2.  **NFR-02 (Payload Encryption):** All sensitive PII (Personal Identifiable Information) in transmission MUST be encrypted using TLS 1.2+ in transit and AES-256 for database storage at rest.
3.  **NFR-03 (Signature Standards):** Digital signatures must adhere strictly to `SHA256WithRSA` standards as mandated by Ethio Telecom.

**Performance & Reliability:** 4. **NFR-04 (Latency):** The payment initialization step (signing & token generation) MUST complete within 200ms to ensure a smooth user experience. 5. **NFR-05 (Availability):** The Payment Gateway Service endpoint MUST maintain 99.9% uptime during business hours. 6. **NFR-06 (Auditability):** All financial API interactions (Requests/Responses) MUST be logged to a centralized logging service (e.g., CloudWatch/PM2 Logs) with timestamps, IP addresses, and Request IDs for a minimum retention period of 1 year. 7. **NFR-07 (Obfuscation):** The Android Mobile Application MUST utilize ProGuard rule sets to obfuscate the payment SDK package `com.huawei.ethiopia.pay.sdk.**` to prevent reverse engineering.
