# Admin Panel API Documentation

This document describes the secure admin-level API endpoints for the marketplace platform.

## üîê Security

**All admin endpoints require authentication and proper authorization:**

## üõ°Ô∏è Permission Levels

- **ADMIN**: Access to all endpoints except user creation and role management
- **SUPER_ADMIN**: Full access to all admin endpoints including:
  - Creating new admin users
  - Managing user roles
  - All standard admin functions

## üìù Error Responses

**401 Unauthorized**: Missing or invalid JWT token
```json
{
  "message": "Unauthorized",
  "statusCode": 401
}
```

**403 Forbidden**: Insufficient role permissions  
```json
{
  "message": "Insufficient permissions",
  "statusCode": 403
}
```

**404 Not Found**: Resource not found
```json
{
  "message": "User not found",
  "statusCode": 404
}
```

## üß™ Testing the Endpoints

All endpoints require authentication. First obtain a JWT token by logging in as an admin user, then include it in the Authorization header:

```bash
# Login as admin to get JWT token
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "admin@example.com", "password": "adminPassword"}'

# Use the token in admin requests
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/admin/stats \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>"
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Performance & Debug Features

### RolesGuard Logging Control
Set `ROLES_GUARD_DEBUG=1` in the environment to enable periodic (throttled to once every 5s per process) grant logs from the RolesGuard. Without this variable, only denials are logged, dramatically reducing noise under rapid admin polling.

### ETag / Conditional GET for User Detail
`GET /api/admin/users/:id` now returns a weak `ETag` header derived from the user's `updatedAt` timestamp, id, and verification status. Clients should send `If-None-Match` on subsequent requests; if unchanged the API responds with `304 Not Modified` and an empty body. Cache hint: `Cache-Control: private, max-age=15`.

Benefits:
- Cuts repeated payload transfer when UI polls or re-focuses the tab
- Reduces server-side serialization work
- Still reflects updates quickly (15s client-side freshness + conditional revalidation)

Example:
```bash
curl -i -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  http://localhost:3000/api/admin/users/42

# Subsequent (unchanged) request using returned ETag value:
curl -i -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H 'If-None-Match: W/"u-abcdef12"' \
  http://localhost:3000/api/admin/users/42
```

## üßπ User Hard Delete (Anonymization)

`DELETE /api/admin/users/:id/hard` no longer performs a physical row deletion (which was failing due to foreign key constraints from reviews/products). Instead it:

- Scrubs personally identifiable & contact fields (email, names, phone, avatars, business data)
- Replaces email with a tombstone format: `deleted+<userId>+<timestamp>@deleted.local` so the original email can be re‚Äëregistered
- Clears roles array and deactivates the account (`isActive=false`)
- Retains the row to preserve referential integrity and historical analytics (existing reviews / products still reference a now anonymized user)

Response: 204 No Content

### Why not cascade delete?
Physical deletion would either:
- Fail (current FK constraints: default NO ACTION), or
- Require adding `onDelete: 'CASCADE'` which risks wiping historical data, or
- Using `SET NULL` which breaks attribution for analytics.

The anonymization approach provides GDPR/PII protection while keeping metrics intact.

### Future Option: Full Cascade / Set NULL
If a project decision prefers true deletion:
1. Add migrations altering foreign keys (e.g., reviews.user) to `ON DELETE SET NULL`.
2. Make relation nullable in the entity.
3. Revert UsersService.remove to real `delete` when no blocking relations remain.

## üîë Auth Error Codes (for client handling)

All auth-related endpoints return structured errors under `error.code` for consistent client UX:

- INVALID_CREDENTIALS: Email/password mismatch
- USER_DEACTIVATED: Account exists but is deactivated (admin can reactivate)
- GOOGLE_NOT_CONFIGURED: Server missing Google client setup
- INVALID_GOOGLE_TOKEN: Bad/expired Google ID token
- GOOGLE_EMAIL_MISSING: Token lacks email
- USER_INACTIVE: Refresh token references a missing/inactive user
- INVALID_REFRESH_TOKEN: Bad/expired refresh token

Shape:
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "USER_DEACTIVATED",
    "message": "User account is deactivated.",
    "details": null
  }
}
```

Admin actions for deactivated accounts:
- PATCH /api/admin/users/:id/reactivate ‚Üí re-enable login
- DELETE /api/admin/users/:id/hard ‚Üí anonymize + free email for re-registration
