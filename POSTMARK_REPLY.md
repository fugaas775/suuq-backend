Hi Postmark Support,

Please find the requested information below to approve our account.

### 1. Details about the messages we plan to send

We are an e-commerce marketplace platform called "Suuq" operating in East Africa. We plan to use Postmark primarily for **transactional emails** triggered by user actions on our platform.

These include:
-   **Account Management**: Welcome emails, password reset requests.
-   **Order Updates**: Order confirmations, shipping notifications, delivery confirmations, and cancellations.
-   **Vendor & Partner Notifications**: notifying vendors of new orders, and assigning delivery partners to orders.
-   **Product Requests & Offers**: Updates when users request products or vendors make offers.
-   **Wallet & Financials**: Withdrawal request confirmations and approvals.

We do not plan to send marketing blasts or newsletters at this stage.

### 2. Branded example message

Here is the HTML source for our **Order Confirmation** email:

```html
<h2>Thank you for your order!</h2>
<p>Hi Customer,</p>

```

### 3. Usage of contacts

All contacts are sourced directly from our users who sign up for our service.
-   **Source**: Users register via our mobile application (iOS/Android) or our website.
-   **Method**: They opt-in by creating an account to browse products, make purchases, or sell items.
-   **Registration Flow**: Users actively submit their email address via our registration form or use social login (Google/Apple) to authorize their account creation. We do not purchase lists or send unsolicited emails to non-users.

We strictly follow data privacy regulations and only email verified users about their account activity and transactions.
